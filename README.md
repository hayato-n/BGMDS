# BGMDS (Bayesian Geographical Multi-Dimensional Scaling)

BGMDS is a variation of MDS (Multi-Dimensional Scaling). This method makes MDS projection to be similar to the original geographical map. It will be useful if you want to visualize some similarities of distances as maps (such as time-distance map) and compare it to the geographical map.

## How to use

The Jupyter Notebook contains the source codes and example. When you run BGMDS, you need 2 classes, "AdamOptimizer" and "BGMDS". If you use this method for your data, copy these classes and paste your codes.
